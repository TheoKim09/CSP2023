    <h1> The game we created is a very well known game of Tic Tac Toe with a Minions theme. You will either be an O or a X to battle against your friends and click on the square where you want to place your shape. We fulfilled the requirements by creating shapes like the Xs, Os, and the squares on the board. Also, we animated the board and it was fun creating this game with my team.
